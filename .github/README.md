## Introduction
I started this bot around June 2019 as a summer project to learn how to code. I worked very hard on it and one year later, the bot is in 100 guilds and has more than 150k users! To be part of Mango's growth, feel free to [invite it](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=497443144632238090&permissions=8&scope=bot) in your server :smile:

Mango will welcome your members with a nice-looking picture with their avatar and the server member count, automatically. You don't have to do anything ;)
