# Mango 
Mango is a Discord bot made in JavaScript that will help you manage your server very easily. It has a lot of commands...

## Commands
- [x] Moderation
- [x] Games & fun (=> tictactoe, hangman...)
- [x] APIs
- [ ] Music (WIP) 

You can get the help message by typing ```ma!help```.

Mango will welcome your members with a nice-looking picture with their avatar and the server member count, automatically. You don't have to do anything ;)
